## Usage 

To integrate Deep Security Agent into the AWS Elastic Beanstalk configuration:

1. Edit the Deep Security Agent AWS Elastic Beanstalk extension configuration file for your operating system to match your Deep Security deployment
1. Add the configuration file to the ```.ebextensions``` directory of your source bundle.
1. Re-deploy your application and your servers will automatically download the latest Agent and activate into the list of instances on the Computers page in Deep Security. 

### Using The .ebextension With Deep Security as a Service

To configure the .ebextension for use with [Deep Security as a Service](https://app.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com/SignIn.screen), you will need to replace 3 items in the appropriate .ebextension. Each of these items is in the final command in the extension (the activation step for the Deep Security agent).

As seen in the [Amazon Linux extension](deep-security-as-a-service/99deepsecurity-as-a-service-amzn1-x86_64.config.ebextension#L9)

```command: '/opt/ds_agent/dsa_control -a dsm://agents.deepsecurity.trendmicro.com:443/ "tenantID:REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-TENANT-ID" "token:REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-TENANT-PASSWORD" "policyid:REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-POLICY-ID" --max-dsm-retries 0 >/tmp/dsa_control.log 2>&1'```

1. ```"tenantID:REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-TENANT-ID"```
1. ```"token:REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-TENANT-PASSWORD"```
1. ```"policyid:REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-POLICY-ID"```

You can find this information within the Deep Security Manager console under **Support > Deployment Scripts**. This dialog will allow you to create a customized deployment script that contains these values.

### Using The .ebextension With Deep Security

To configure the .ebextension for use with your own Deep Security deployment, you will need to replace 3 items in the appropriate .ebextension. These items is in the final command in the extension (the activation step for the Deep Security agent).
